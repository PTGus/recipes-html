		<h2>About This Recipe</h2>

			These classic mashed potatoes turn simple ingredients into pure comfort—silky, fluffy, and rich without ever feeling heavy.
			 Using humble russets, warm milk, and plenty of butter, this method brings out their natural creaminess while keeping every bite smooth and lump-free.
			  By boiling the potatoes gently, drying them briefly, and mashing them while still steaming, you get a texture that's irresistibly light and beautifully buttery.
