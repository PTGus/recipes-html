		<p>
			This beloved lasagna recipe is a hearty, slow-simmered classic that layers rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta,
			 and perfectly melted mozzarella into a comforting, oven-baked masterpiece. Built on a flavorful base of Italian
			 sausage, ground beef, tomatoes, herbs, and garlic, the sauce cooks low and slow to develop deep, savory richness.
			 Combined with tender noodles and three cheeses, it creates a dish that’s indulgent, aromatic, and incredibly satisfying.
		</p>

			Though it takes time and care to prepare, the result is well worth the effort:
			 a beautifully structured lasagna with balanced seasoning, a luscious texture, and a taste that only gets better the next day.
			 Whether served at a family gathering or enjoyed as leftovers, this recipe lives
			  up to its reputation as one of the most celebrated and reliable lasagnas ever shared online.

			<li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
			<li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
			<li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
			<li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
			<li>
				Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
				 Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
				 Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
				 Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
				 Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
			</li>
			<li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
			<li>
				To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
				 Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
				  Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
				   Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
				 Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
			</li>
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
