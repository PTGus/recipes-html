	<h2>About this recipe</h2>
	<p>
		This beloved lasagna recipe is a hearty, slow-simmered classic that layers rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta,
		 and perfectly melted mozzarella into a comforting, oven-baked masterpiece. Built on a flavorful base of Italian
		 sausage, ground beef, tomatoes, herbs, and garlic, the sauce cooks low and slow to develop deep, savory richness.
		 Combined with tender noodles and three cheeses, it creates a dish that’s indulgent, aromatic, and incredibly satisfying.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though it takes time and care to prepare, the result is well worth the effort:
		 a beautifully structured lasagna with balanced seasoning, a luscious texture, and a taste that only gets better the next day.
		 Whether served at a family gathering or enjoyed as leftovers, this recipe lives
		  up to its reputation as one of the most celebrated and reliable lasagnas ever shared online.
